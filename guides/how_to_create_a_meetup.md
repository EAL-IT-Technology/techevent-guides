How to create a meetup
============================

We do the official info page on [meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/EAL-tech-events/) - that includes signing up for events.

The description to be used below, could be following the template:
* who are we (might no be relevant in most contexts)
* what is this
* who is the target audience
* what to get out of it
* call to action (aka. how to sign sign up now)


1) Send an email to [Morten](mailto:mon@eal.dk) with the content

    Subject:

        Techevents <type> the <date> on meetup

    Body:

        Dear Morten

        We would like to get our event on the tech event meetup page.

        Event name: <EAL + type + more, if appl.>
        The location: <location>
        Start date is: <date + time>
