How to inform facility services about events
============================

The aggreement with facility services is that we tell them when we have events, where there might be people all night or at other off-hours.


1) Send an email to [Facility](mailto:facility@support.eal.dk) with the content

    Subject:

        Techevents <type> the <date>

    Body:

        Dear Facility

        We would like to inform you that we have an event on the weekend the <from date> to <end date>
        
        The contact person for this event is <name>, and he may be reached on <phone number>
        We expect to be around <number> people and will primarily be at <building and floor number>

        We know that 
        * windows are not to be opened
        * only the front doors are to be used
        * they are not to be kept open for more than Â½-1 minute.
        * we are not allowed to sleep at school

        This is something we will inform the participants about.

        Regards

        <your names>
